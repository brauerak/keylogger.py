Keylogger Project
--------------------------------------------------

This is a Python-based keylogger project created for educational purposes only. The program listens to keyboard events, logs the pressed keys, and sends the captured data to a specified email address.

Features
 --------------------------------------------
	•	Captures all keystrokes, including special keys (e.g., Enter, Space).
	•	Logs keystrokes into a local text file (keylog.txt).
	•	Sends the log file to an email address after stopping the program.
	•	Simple and customizable implementation.
 
How It Works
 --------------------------------------------
	1.	The program starts listening to keyboard events when executed.
	2.	Every key press is logged into the keylog.txt file.
	3.	Pressing the Esc key stops the program, triggers the email functionality, and sends the log file to the specified email.
